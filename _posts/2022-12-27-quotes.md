Some of my favorite quotes from eminent scientists, authors , entrepreneurs and engineers.


```
Finding fulfilling work is extremely difficult.

“Fall in love with some activity, and do it!

Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter.

Explore the world.

Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.

Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best.

Don't think about what you want to be, but what you want to do.

Keep up some kind of a minimum with other things so that society doesn't stop you from doing anything at all.”

-- Richard Feynman,Physicist
