[*M.Tech. Thesis under Prof. Hamim Zafar*] Implemented Disentangled Multimodal VAE (DMVAE) and Total Variational Inference framework (TotalVI) to generate private latent representation of genes and protein on CITE seq dataset.

Benchmarked the model and obtained 16% performance improvement on ARI metric of cell-type clustering compared to SOTA models.Working on hierarchical Bayesian VAE based models to obtain better performance on cell-type clustering.

Tools used: *Pytorch Lightning, Scanpy*

*Individual Project*
