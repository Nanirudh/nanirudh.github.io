create <parent dir inode no> <file name>         creates a file. Input: parent directory inode no and file name <br>
delete  <inode> <parent dir inode>               deletes a file. Input: inode of file and parent directory inode <br>
cat <inode>                                      prints the contents of a file to stdout. Input: inode of file <br>
copyin  <file> <inode>                           copies the contents in file to file pointed by inode. Input: filename and inode no
copyout <inode> <file>                           copies the contents from the file pointed by inode to file. Input: inode no and file name
mkdir <path>                                     path of the directory to be created . Input: path Eg./test
help                                             lists out all the commands with arguments
