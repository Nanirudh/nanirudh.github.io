Hi! I'm Anirudh.I'm currently pursuing MTech CSE  from IIT  Kanpur.I would be graduating in June'23. I'm working on my thesis with [Prof.Hamim Zafar] (https://hamimzafar.wixsite.com/home) on **Representation Learning of Single cell Multiomics datasets**.

I worked as a Software engineer at **Salesforce**, Hyderabad for one year.I was part of the Application Security team.My interests lie in Distributed Systems, Operating Systems, Probabilistic ML and Generative Modelling.

I'm a big fan of Marvel movies and like to binge watch latest science fiction shows :grinning: .Feel free to connect with me on Linkedin.



I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Science Bangalore. Prior to this, I have worked as a Data Scientist in IBM India Pvt. Ltd after completing my Masters in Control and Computing from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.

During my stint in IBM, I have worked on some client-facing projects which involved deep learning applications in the domain of object detection and tracking of persons in video feed. I have also worked on NLP projects in my leisure hours.

As a novice PhD student working with [Dr. Sriram Ganapathy](http://www.leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram/), I am presently learning the basics of Speech Processing and hope to contribute to the field by means of Deep Learning. I am associated with the wonderful group of people (and researchers) at [LEAP Lab](http://www.leap.ee.iisc.ac.in).

Academics takes up most of my time. However, I had started learning the piano before the pandemic. I hope to play [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7maJOI3QMu0) and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imGaOIm5HOk) someday.
